Born of a hackathon idea, last Spring some friends and I founded <a href=http://vr.berkeley.edu/#/" > Virtual Reality at Berkeley </a>.

### Making Something From Nothing
The idea of creating a club dedicated to Virtual Reality was first proposed to
me by Daniel Pok one Sunday afternoon in a Pieology.  After a lot of hesitation,
we decided to move forward.

We were three guys with a Google cardboard, an idea, and not enough free time.
But after a semester of school, hours of meetings, and many emails begging professors,
we had officially become a registered club under the name "Virtual Reality at Berkeley".
I wanted to be called "Daydreams" but my club-mates did not share my vision.

We connected with existing research groups on campus so we actually had VR stuff
to do.  I was lucky enough to be able to work with a Drone group on campus who
wanted to use AI to navigate rooms.  SO.  COOL.

I'm no longer with VR@B since I decided my main interests lied in other fields,
but I'm very grateful for the work my friends put and continue to put into the
club.
