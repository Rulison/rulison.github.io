This post is a summary of the work I did over two years at Laura Waller's Berkeley Optics lab.

The end result is <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276361796_Multi-Contrast_Imaging_and_Digital_Refocusing_on_a_Mobile_Microscope_with_a_Domed_LED_Array"> this paper </a>.

It's a cell phone microscope!  What's special is how the subject is lit.  The dome uses a spherical dome of hundreds of white LEDs, each individually controlled.  As described in the paper, this allows for digital refocusing, DPC, and more.

On the EE side, I was responsible for designing the PCBs that would allow for individual control of the LEDs.  Each board had about 4 LED controller chips that each controlled about 32 lights.  Once the parts were complete and fabricated I helped solder the boards and all 576 LEDs together in the 3D-printed casing.

On the CS side, I helped to write and optimize the C++ code for the DPC and digital refocusing, all of which is done on the phone.

I'm no longer involved in the lab so I can focus on other opportunities, but as far as I know that next steps for this project are using RGB lights, and making it much much much bigger.
